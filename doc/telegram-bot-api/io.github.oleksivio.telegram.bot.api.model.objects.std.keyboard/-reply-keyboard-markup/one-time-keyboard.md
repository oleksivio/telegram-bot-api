# oneTimeKeyboard

`var oneTimeKeyboard: `[`Boolean`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-boolean/index.html)`?`

one_time_keyboard Boolean Optional. Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as it's been used. The keyboard
will still be available, but clients will automatically display the usual letter-keyboard in the chat â€“ the user
can press a special button in the input field to see the custom keyboard again. Defaults to false.
