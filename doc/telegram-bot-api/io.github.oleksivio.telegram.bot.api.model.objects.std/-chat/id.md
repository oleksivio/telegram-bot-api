# id

`var id: `[`Long`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-long/index.html)

id Integer Unique identifier for this chat. This number may be greater than 32 bits and some programming languages
may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it is smaller than 52 bits, so a signed 64 bit integer
or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier.
